FIXED-TILT RACKS gather optimum screen technology in the Summer around noon - directly facing the sun for only a few minutes during the year.

Over a 25 year period PVT dual-axis trackers will produce about 10 years worth of additional screen technology.

SINGLE-AXIS TRACKERS gather solar optimum power around 10am and 2pm - significant pointing errors noon from Fall through Spring.

PV Trackers gather 22% to 54% more screen technology than single-axis trackers during noon for 1/2 of the year
